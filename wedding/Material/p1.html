<h4> before the wedding,</h4>
<ul>
<li>friends and relatives bring old porcelain and kitchenware to throw on the ground in front of bride and groom.
 This is supposed to grant them a happy,
 lucky life; that's why this evening event is called Polterabend--the evening with lots of broken porcelain.
 The German proverb--Scherben bringen Glück--which can be translated as "Broken crockery brings you luck." is derived from this custom. The Polterabend often develops into an informal and casual party.</li></br>

<li>A German bride to be wears a simple gold band on her<B> left hand</B>. After the wedding, the bride and groom wear their rings on their<B> right hands.</B></li>

<h4>At the Wedding</h4>

<ol>
<li> Gather friends and family  for a traditional religious ceremony. This second ceremony is necessary because it's illegal in Germany to have only a church wedding.</li>
<li>Provide the bride with salt and bread to carry during the ceremony as a predictor of a good harvest. The groom should carry grain which symbolizes wealth and good fortune. </li>

<li> Add German humor to the festivities whenever appropriate . During the vows,the couple is on their knees.When the two stand, the bride might step on the groom's foot to show her disagreement.</li>

<h4>After the Wedding</h4>
As the couple leaves, they'll toss coins to children in the group and then it's time for the log cutting. Have a log on a sawhorse ready and provide the couple with a saw. The bride and groom must then cut the log in half, symbolizing the first tough task of their lives accomplished together.
