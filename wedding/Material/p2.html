<h4>Wedding Superstitions in Turkey </h4>
<ul>
<li>In Turkey, when a girl gets married, all her female friends write their names inside her bridal shoes. After the wedding ceremony, if someone's name has been rubbed off and can not be read anymore, it means this person is going to get married next.</li>
 <li>If you get married between two annual religious festivals that are two months apart, you might be unlucky. </li>
</ul>

<h4>The Turkish marriage celebration</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Turkish marriage celebration continues after the wedding ceremony for several days. The newlywed bride may return home the morning after her wedding vows to see her family and friends, who then might perform a henna ritual on her.</li>

<li>A Muslim wedding program in Turkey lasts from four to seven days, starting with separate celebrations of the bride and groom's families. From this day on, the couple getting married cannot see each other until their wedding ceremony.</li>

<li>A Turkish bride might wear a beautifully embroidered silk wedding dress with a red velvet cape.</li>
